# Lines of Credit

YieldBlox offers lines of credit to institutions using a whitelisted address system. This allows institutions to take out loans without providing collateral. This function helps trusted Stellar-based remittance companies and market makers to solve working capital constraints using YieldBlox. This functionality will not be available in the alpha release of YieldBlox. It will be added when the beta launches.

## How are institutions approved for institutional lines of credit?

The YieldBlox [governance process](../governance.md) is used to approve institutions for lines of credit and whitelist their Stellar addresses. If you're an institution interested in a line of credit, reach out to us, and we'll help you put together a governance proposal!

## What is the interest rate paid on lines of credit?

Lines of credit always use [fixed interest rates](interest-rates.md#how-do-loan-interest-rates-work).

## How large are YieldBlox lines of credit?

Institutions who use a [governance proposal](../governance.md) to apply for a YieldBlox line of credit include a requested line of credit size in their initial governance proposal application. This line of credit size will be assessed by the community, based on the organization's creditworthiness. The institution can create proposals to increase this line of credit size in the future. Additionally, they can [stake YBX](../staking.md) to increase their line of credit size.

## What happens if an institution defaults on its line of credit?

If an entity defaults on their line of credit, they will have their whitelisted address status removed and may be liable for legal action by the YieldBlox DAO. Additionally, if they were [staking YBX](../staking.md) to increase their line of credit size, their staked YBX will be forfeited to the protocol. 

Additionally, the [YBX default protection](../ybx-tokens/ybx-backstop.md) system will compensate the lending pool for the default.
